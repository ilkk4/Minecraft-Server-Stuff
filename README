Modpack Installation Guide

This repository contains a custom Minecraft modpack profile that you can easily import into the CurseForge Client.

ðŸ“¥ Step 1 â€” Install the CurseForge Client

Go to the CurseForge download page.

Download the client for your operating system (Windows or macOS).

Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

Launch the CurseForge Client.

ðŸ“¦ Step 2 â€” Download the Modpack Profile

In this repository, locate the .zip file for the modpack profile (usually in the releases section or the modpack/ folder).

Click the file name to download it to your computer.

Do not unzip the file â€” the CurseForge Client imports .zip profiles directly.

ðŸš€ Step 3 â€” Import the Modpack into CurseForge

Open the CurseForge Client.

Select Minecraft from the game list.

In the top-right corner, click the Create Custom Profile button.

Choose Import (usually a tab or button within the profile creation window).

Select the .zip file you downloaded from this repository.

Wait for the client to install the modpack and all required mods.

ðŸŽ® Step 4 â€” Play the Modpack

Once installed, find your modpack in the My Modpacks section of the CurseForge Client.

Click Play â€” the Minecraft Launcher will open.

Log in (if needed) and start the game.
